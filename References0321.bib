	abstract = {Objective. While many studies report that green spaces promote mental health, some suggest the psychological beneﬁts of physical activity are ampliﬁed if participation occurs within greener environs. We investigated whether this relationship could be observed among adults in middle-to-older age.
Method. Multilevel logit regression was used to investigate association between green space and psychological distress (Kessler scores of 22+) among 260,061 Australians over 45 years old living in New South Wales (2006–2009). Physical activity was measured using the Active Australia survey. Percentage green space was estimated within a 1-kilometre of residence.
Results. In comparison to residents of the least green areas, those in the greenest neighbourhoods were at a lower risk of psychological distress (Odds Ratio 0.83, 95\% CI: 0.76, 0.92) and were less sedentary (0.81: 0.77, 0.87). An interaction was observed between physical activity and green space (p = 0.0028). More green space did not appear to beneﬁt mental health among the least active (0.99: 0.85, 1.15), but there was a protective association for the more physically active (0.82: 0.67, 0.99).
Conclusion. For adults in middle-to-older age, green spaces are not only important for promoting physical activity, but the mental health beneﬁts of greener environs appear contingent upon those active lifestyles. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Though several studies have ascertained that nearby residents tend to view greenways as positive or neutral amenities that increase or have no discernible impact on property values and saleability, these results are mostly based on anecdote rather than actual market data. Using the hedonic pricing method, this study demonstrates that greenways may indeed have significant positive impacts on proximate properties' sales prices. Adjacency to a greenbelt produced significant property value premiums in two of three neighborhoods. Physical access to a greenbelt had a significant, positive impact in one case, but was insignificant in two others. No negative greenway impacts were recorded.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the relationship between the sales prices of single-family properties and green-space characteristics for three communities in Los Angeles County. The results shed light on how green spaces geographically influence property values in two different prototypes of urban growth: planned versus unplanned communities. Quantitative results reveal that property values inconsistently reflect five major attributes of green spaces (view, distance, size, type, and character). In the planned community, proximity to golf courses and active recreational green spaces had negative impacts on property values, while views of green spaces and proximity to greenways, large green spaces, and passive recreational green spaces had significant positive impacts. Their impact was less significant in the communities characterized by unplanned growth. The findings signify that different attributes of green spaces impact property values in unique ways in planned versus unplanned communities. Considering overall effects, the findings indicate that green spaces have a more positive influence on home values in planned communities.},

	abstract = {This study explores the impacts of multimodal accessibility to green space on housing price. Quantifying the benefits of green space accessibility is important for supporting green infrastructure planning and guiding land use development. In this study, we calculate multimodal travel times (walking and driving) from each residential property in Cook County (Chicago metro), Illinois to each articulated (public or significant private) green space. A gravity-model based method is used to compute accessibility (by travel mode), which considers the access to multiple green spaces and weights prioritization. Green spaces are divided into seven categories depending on their type and size to differentiate their potential benefits. Hedonic models using housing structural features, locational attributes, socio-economic factors and green space accessibility as explanatory variables, are used to evaluate housing price (using housing transactions records from 2010 sales in the county). The spatial effects of green space accessibilities on housing prices are explored by an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, with and without fixed locational effects, and a Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). Results show walking and driving accessibility to all sizes of recreational, medium conversational and private green spaces present positive impacts on housing price, with some negative impacts to larger (and smaller) conservation areas. The relationship also exhibits different heterogeneous spatial pattern over the study area between walking and driving accessibility to green space, possibly related to economic variation.},

Due to the constant environmental, social, and economic transformations of cities, UGSs pose new challenges for management, particularly in fast-growing metropolitan areas. With technological advancement and the evolution of deep learning, it is possible to optimize the acquisition of UGS inventories through the detection of geometric patterns present in satellite imagery. This research evaluates two deep learning model techniques for semantic segmentation of UGS polygons with the use of different convolutional neural network encoders on the U-Net architecture and very high resolution (VHR) imagery to obtain updated information on UGS polygons at the metropolitan area level. The best model yielded a Dice coefﬁcient of 0.57, IoU of 0.75, recall of 0.80, and kappa coefﬁcient of 0.94 with an overall accuracy of 0.97, which reﬂects a reliable performance of the network in detecting patterns that make up the varied geometry of UGSs. A complete database of UGS polygons was quantiﬁed and categorized by types with location and delimited by municipality, allowing for the standardization of the information at the metropolitan level, which will be useful for comparative analysis with a homogenized and updated database.

	abstract = {Eﬀective urban planning, and urban green space management in particular, require proper data on urban green spaces. The potential of urban green spaces to provide beneﬁts to urban inhabitants (ecosystem services) depends on whether they are managed as a comprehensive system of urban green infrastructure, or as isolated islands falling under the responsibility of diﬀerent stakeholders. Meanwhile, diﬀerent urban green space datasets are based on diﬀerent deﬁnitions, data sources, sampling techniques, time periods and scales, which poses important challenges to urban green infrastructure planning, management and research. Using the case study of Lodz, the third largest city in Poland, and an additional analysis of 17 other Polish cities, we compare data from ﬁve publicly available sources: 1) public statistics, 2) the national land surveying agency, 3) satellite imagery (Landsat data), 4) the Urban Atlas, 5) the Open Street Map. The results reveal large diﬀerences in the total amount of urban green spaces in the cities as depicted in diﬀerent datasets. In Lodz, the narrowly interpreted public statistics data, which are aspatial, suggest that green spaces account for only 12.8\% of city area, while the most comprehensive dataset from the national land surveying agency reveals the ﬁgure of 61.2\%. The former dataset, which excludes many types of green spaces (such as arable land, private and informal green spaces), is still the most commonly used. The analysis of the 17 other cities conﬁrms the same pattern. This results in broader institutional failures related to urban green infrastructure planning, management, and research, including a lack of awareness of green space quality (e.g. connectivity) and beneﬁts (ecosystem services), and the related political disregard for urban green spaces. Our comparison suggests that a better understanding of green space data sources is necessary in urban planning, and especially when planning urban green infrastructure.},

However, it also poses extremely concerning challenges to low-income residents. To help policymakers take targeted and early action in protecting low-income residents, researchers have recently proposed several machine learning models to predict gentrification using socioeconomic and image features. Building upon previous studies, we propose a novel graph-based multimodal deep learning framework to predict gentrification based on urban networks of tracts and essential facilities (e.g., schools, hospitals, and subway stations). We train and test the proposed framework using data from Chicago, New York City, and Los Angeles. The model successfully predicts census-tract level gentrification with 0.9 precision on average. Moreover, the framework discovers a previously unexamined strong relationship between schools and gentrification, which provides a basis for further exploration of social factors affecting gentrification.},

Sentinel-2 imagery cannot distinguish public from private green spaces and its spatial resolution of 10 m fails to capture ﬁne-grained urban structures, while in OSM green spaces are not mapped consistently and with the same level of completeness everywhere. To address these limitations, we propose to fuse these data sets under explicit consideration of their uncertainties. The Sentinel-2 derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index was fused with OSM data using the Dempster–Shafer theory to enhance the detection of small vegetated areas. The distinction between public and private green spaces was achieved using a Bayesian hierarchical model and OSM data. The analysis was performed based on land use parcels derived from OSM data and tested for the city of Dresden, Germany. The overall accuracy of the ﬁnal map of public urban green spaces was 95\% and was mainly inﬂuenced by the uncertainty of the public accessibility model.},

	abstract = {Human behavior is a key driver of the biodiversity crisis, and addressing it requires changing individual choices and actions. Yet, the same processes that imperil biodiversity (e.g., urbanization) also alienate people from the experience of nature, eroding care for the natural world. Although averting this extinction of experience is increasingly recognized as a major contemporary conservation challenge, understanding of what constitutes nature experience remains elusive and few empirical studies have explored it directly. Most researchers have used nature interactions as a stand-in for experience, even though experience extends beyond interactions. We aimed to determine what constitutes the experience of nature and to propose a holistic, empirically derived framework that incorporates the multiple dimensions and components of the experience of nature. Using a mixed-method approach across 3 countries (the United States, Switzerland, and Israel), we conducted a multistage, conceptual content, cognitive mapping (3CM) exercise with 106 participants. This methodology included developing a prompt to capture participants’ perceptions of nature experiences and subsequently reﬁning and organizing their input into distinct components and underlying dimensions through an iterative engagement process. Beyond multisensory interactions with nature, experience of nature consisted of 2 dimensions: the circumstances in which interactions occur and the internal responses that encompass various cognitive, affective, and restorative beneﬁts associated with nature interactions. These 3 dimensions had 33 components that occurred consistently across participants in the 3 countries. Frequently mentioned components included seeing animals, landscapes, or scenery; lack of human inﬂuence; weather conditions; relaxing, recharging; feeling good; and awe for nature. Fear and nature experienced at home were the least mentioned components. Together, our results showed that nature experience is a combination of nature interactions, circumstances, and internal responses. The emphasized components underscore the signiﬁcance of offering access to extensive, less human-inﬂuenced natural spaces. This in turn can foster a profound nature experience, cultivating feelings of connectedness and care for nature.},

	abstract = {Background: There is a growing interest in research investigating the association between green space (GS) and mental health and wellbeing (HWB), in order to understand the underlying mechanisms. Accordingly, there is a need to map the literature and create an overview of the research. Methods: A scoping review approach was used to map literature on GS, including context and co-exposures (the GS exposome), and their associations with mental HWB. The review considers mental HWB definitions and measurements and how GS is characterized. Furthermore, the review aims to identify knowledge gaps and make recommendations for future research. Results: We identified a great diversity in study designs, definitions, outcome measures, consideration of the totality of the GS exposome, and reporting of results. Around 70\% of the 263 reviewed studies reported a positive association between some aspect of GS and HWB. However, there is a limited amount of research using randomized controlled crossover trails (RCTs) and mixed methods and an abundance of qualitative subjective research. Conclusions: The discords between study designs, definitions, and the reporting of results makes it difficult to aggregate the evidence and identify any potential causal mechanisms. We propose key points to consider when defining and quantifying GS and make recommendations for reporting on research investigating GS and mental HWB. This review highlights a need for large well-designed RCTs that reliably measure the GS exposome in relation to mental HWB.},

	abstract = {We compare the restorative effects on cognitive functioning of interactions with natural versus urban environments. Attention restoration theory (ART) provides an analysis of the kinds of environments that lead to improvements in directed-attention abilities. Nature, which is ﬁlled with intriguing stimuli, modestly grabs attention in a bottom-up fashion, allowing top-down directed-attention abilities a chance to replenish. Unlike natural environments, urban environments are ﬁlled with stimulation that captures attention dramatically and additionally requires directed attention (e.g., to avoid being hit by a car), making them less restorative. We present two experiments that show that walking in nature or viewing pictures of nature can improve directed-attention abilities as measured with a backwards digit-span task and the Attention Network Task, thus validating attention restoration theory.},

	abstract = {Urban greenspace plays an essential role in urban ecosystem and highly contributes to the welfare of urban residents. Understanding the dynamics of greenspace is crucial for its planning and management. Previous studies have largely focused on changes in greenspace in urbanizing regions, using medium resolution remotely sensed data. However, the changes of greenspace in urbanized areas need to be accurately quantiﬁed based on high spatial resolution images because they are directly related to human health and well-being. This paper aims to enhance the understanding on dynamics of greenspace within well-developed areas of the city, using Beijing City, China as a case study. Using high spatial resolution remotely sensed imagery, we analyzed the spatial pattern of greenspace and its change on two scales: (1) the entire area within the 5th ring road, and (2) in 4 belts from urban center to fringe. We found urban greenspace was very dynamic. The proportion of urban greenspace increased by 5.45\%, or 36.3 km2 in size from 2005 to 2009. The amounts of gain and loss of greenspace were 69 km2 and 32.7 km2, respectively, or 10.36\% and 4.91\% of the entire study area. Because of the very limited lands for greening in urbanized areas, the new patches of greenspace were generally small, with the mean patch size of 676.31 m2. However, those small patches enhanced the connectivity and continuity of urban greenspace. In addition, we found the differences in conﬁguration of greenspace patches across the 4 belts were greater than the differences in total percent cover, indicating that compared to percent coverage, greenspace conﬁguration may be more inﬂuenced by the development age.},

However, UGS maps at the global scale with acceptable accuracies are not readily available. In this study, we mapped UGS of all 1039 mid- and large-sized cities across the globe in 2015 with dense remote sensing data (i.e. 51 494 Landsat images) and Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Also, we quantified the spatial distribution and accessibility of UGS within the cities. By combining the greenest pixel compositing method and the percentile-based image compositing method, we were able to obtain the maximum extent of UGS in cities while better differentiating UGS from other vegetation such as croplands.},

We use self-reported information on life satisfaction and two individual green space measures to explore how urban green space affects the well-being of the residents of Berlin, the capital city of Germany. We combine spatially explicit survey data with spatially highly disaggregated GIS data on urban green space. We observe a signiﬁcant, inverted U-shaped effect of the amount of and distance to urban green space on life satisfaction. According to our results, the amount of green space in a 1 km buffer that leads to the largest positive effect on life satisfaction is 35 ha or 11\% of the buffer area. In our sample, 75\% of the respondents have less green space available.},
