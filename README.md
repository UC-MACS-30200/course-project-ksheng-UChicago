### Introduction

Urban Green Space (UGS) shows continuous influence on urban residents’ well-being, urban social equality, and economic benefits in previous studies. Studying the actual value of UGS in different urban environments can help justify people’s natural preference for green space in the city, facilitate policies to alleviate urban segregation, and create significant economic benefits by improving land value.

### Research Questions: 

* What is the economic value of UGS in the city center vs. the city fringe?

* How does the spatial cognition differ between tourists and residents in landmark UGS?
